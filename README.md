These are my unoptimized solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

As soon as I get the right answer, I typically stop improving the code, so don't come here looking for a clean code :)
I do however use verbose variable and method names, so it should be easy to understand I hope.

If there are 2 solution files, typically one would be for part 1 and another for part 2.
If there is 1 file, it either outputs both solutions or part 1 is commented out.

These are written for PHP 8.2, but might work in other versions of PHP.
